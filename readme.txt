== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What difference does it make? =

ImageMagick can result in huge improvements in the quality of re-sized images.

Take a look at the supplied screenshot, or try it yourself. More examples will be available on the plugin website (http://wp.orangelab.se/imagemagick-engine/).

Note that the new images tend to be slightly larger than those of the standard GD library, especially if you specify a very high image quality (95+).

= How do I know if I have ImageMagick installed? =

If you have the PHP module installed the plugin will find it. You can check yourself using the phpinfo() function. We also automatically check a common location for the ImageMagick executable.

If you have shell access to a Linux/UNIX server you can use "which convert" to look for the ImageMagick executable.

= How do I install ImageMagick? =

You'll need full access to your server and a bit of technical know-how. If you do not have access you'll have to ask the server administrator.

Don't do it yourself unless you know what you are doing.

Most Linux distributions have a package for "ImageMagick". Some have a package for "php5-imagick". It is also possible to install the PHP module using the PEAR.

You can also find binary releases  at http://www.imagemagick.org including Windows installer.
